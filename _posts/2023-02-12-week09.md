title: "Week 9: Group Work Reflection"
---
I still feel paranoid that we aren’t doing enough, but I feel a bit more secure in the group project’s direction. It seems like now that we’ve emailed the maintainer and gained a response, we at least have some connection if we have any questions. We also submitted our first pull request for an issue in the “Friendly Error System” of p5.js, which is pretty exciting. We’re hoping to continue working on the Friendly Error System now that we’re more familiar with its structure.

Although we made some contact with a maintainer, I still feel like we need to reach out more? Or do more work on our own? I’m not really sure about what the expected output of this group project is supposed to be; I’m not sure if we’re doing enough or if we should be doing more. I feel a little behind since I’m not as familiar with JavaScript as my members, but I’m trying my best to catch up and contribute in other ways. Otherwise, I’ve been really enjoying working in a group; it’s easier to understand problems by trying to explain them to someone else, and obviously it’s great to have people more knowledgeable than me so I don’t have to do extreme Google searching every time I run into a problem.
