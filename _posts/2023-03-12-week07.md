title: "Week 7: Group Work Initial Reflection"
---
I’m super excited to work on our group project. I was already interested in Processing, a foundation focused on creative coding, so I’m glad I have an excuse to learn more about p5.js, one of their sponsored works. I’ve contributed to p5.js before and found the community super inviting for newbies. It seems like my teammates and I also have similar interests and goals for this class, so we’ll have some good energy working together.

I’m kind of worried that our project is too small; since p5.js is just a JavaScript library, not much coding is required. If there’s not much to work on, I think we could maybe work with the Processing foundation in general, which supports a bunch of projects. I’m also worried about skill differences in our group; I don’t think I’m as experienced in coding as my teammates, but I hope that I can find a way to contribute with my strengths or just devote more time to figuring out code.  

By the end of this project, I hope that I can become a p5.js expert and integrate it into other personal projects. It’ll be really fun just to try out different features of the library and understand how they work. It would also be great to reach out to the ITP program at NYU. I mentioned to a friend that we were working on p5.js, and he told me that [one of the professors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Shiffman) in the ITP department co-founded Processing.
