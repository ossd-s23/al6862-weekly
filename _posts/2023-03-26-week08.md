title: "Week 8: Group Work Reflection and Jim's Talk"
---
Jim's talk was really sweet! I'm glad he touched on the toy CPU; I read about it and thought it was really cute. I especially liked that he added a “sticky note” to remind his students of instructions. I also enjoyed his discussion on a greater focus on computing history. I always think that the fun parts of CS are topics so far away from more primitive and early technologies, but it was good to remember there exists not only important but interesting projects that focus on those early technologies.

I’m a little worried about our group progress, but I’m not sure if I need to be? I think that I imagined the scope of our work to be much larger, but the group project is supposed to be only two months long, and we're supposed to finish only two months worth of work. Otherwise, it’s been fun exploring p5.js and playing around with it. Even though I didn’t have much experience with p5.js before, because it’s built for non-coders, it’s pretty easy to understand and use. It’s also impressive to see the example projects others have built for it when it seems like such a simple library. Working with a group is also fun too; it feels less lonely and depressing than coding by yourself in your apartment.
