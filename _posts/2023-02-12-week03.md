title: "Week 3: Git and Browser Extension Project"
---
My only previous experience in git was a personal project, so I never used upstreams or branches before. I feel like a lot of git commands are combinations of other commands, so I’ve always confused commands like pull and merge. The git exercise was helpful in clarifying these commands for me and furthering my understanding of how to work in a repository with others.

I never had to collaborate with teammates in a repository before, and it was honestly challenging to navigate initially. Furthermore, it was hard to feel a skill disparity that I hadn’t felt before; I started coding last fall and this is my first CS elective ever. I didn’t know how to merge branches or create pull requests, so I felt pretty apologetic to my team. Because this was also a short project, I was never sure if I should ask for clarification or stick it out. Regardless, my teammates were luckily super understanding and always helped me out when I asked. I tried to be honest with my skill level and chose tasks that I knew I could do. I’ve always heard I organize my writing well, so I wrote the project documents and made the presentation slides. It was super valuable looking at other open source projects while trying to make my own. I think I understand more on how to operate both in GitHub and open source projects in general.
